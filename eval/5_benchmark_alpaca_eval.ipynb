    "# AlpacaEval 2 Benchmark Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Purpose\n",
    "This notebook implements **AlpacaEval 2** evaluation to assess instruction-following quality of our fine-tuned LLaMA-2-7B model. This is a critical component of the evaluation framework required by [Assignment 7](../../tasks/Assignment7.md) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our LoRA fine-tuning approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Context\n",
    "Following the complete fine-tuning pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[Baseline Model Evaluation](baseline_model.ipynb)** - Established baseline performance metrics\n",
    "2. **[Fine-tuning Process](finetune_model.ipynb)** - LoRA fine-tuning on Dolly-15K dataset  \n",
    "3. **This Notebook** - AlpacaEval 2 evaluation of fine-tuned model\n",
    "4. **MT-Bench Evaluation** - Multi-turn dialogue assessment (separate notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "## AlpacaEval 2 Framework\n",
    "- **Repository**: https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Standardized evaluation dataset for instruction-following models\n",
    "- **Dataset**: 805 diverse instruction-following examples\n",
    "- **Method**: Generate responses with our model, then use automated judge (GPT-4) to compare against reference responses\n",
    "- **Metrics**: Win rate (how often our model's response is preferred over reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Improvements\n",
    "After LoRA fine-tuning on Dolly-15K, we expect to see:\n",
    "- **Higher win rates** against reference responses\n",
    "- **Better instruction following** quality\n",
    "- **More helpful and coherent** responses\n",
    "- **Improved formatting** and structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Implementation\n",
    "- **Model**: Fine-tuned LLaMA-2-7B with LoRA adapters\n",
    "- **Process**: \n",
    "  1. Load our fine-tuned model\n",
    "  2. Generate responses to AlpacaEval dataset instructions\n",
    "  3. Use GPT-4 as automated judge to compare our responses vs. reference responses\n",
    "  4. Calculate win rate (percentage of times our response is preferred)\n",
    "- **Comparison**: Fine-tuned vs. baseline model win rates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "1. **Load fine-tuned model** from saved LoRA adapters\n",
    "2. **Load AlpacaEval dataset** (805 instruction examples)\n",
    "3. **Generate responses** using our fine-tuned model\n",
    "4. **Run automated evaluation** using GPT-4 judge to compare against reference responses\n",
    "5. **Calculate win rate** and compare with baseline model results\n",
    "6. **Document metrics** for final report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Criteria\n",
    "- **Higher win rate** than baseline model on AlpacaEval dataset\n",
    "- **Measurable improvement** in instruction-following quality\n",
    "- **Consistent performance** across different instruction types\n",
    "- **Clear evidence** of fine-tuning effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Note**: This evaluation is essential for demonstrating that our LoRA fine-tuning approach successfully improves the model's instruction-following capabilities on the Dolly-15K dataset.\n"
